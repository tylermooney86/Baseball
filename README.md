# Baseball
Analysis of MLB statistics

## Goals
My hope for this project is that I will develop a better understanding of the foundational concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning by analyzing baseball statistics. I will use this README.md file to document the progress that I make at each stage.

## Planning
I will start with analysis of pitchers. 

  Step 1: Find data source
  
  Step 2: Create visualizations of data
  
  Step 3: Analyze data to determine which predictions I want to make
